# wordle-c-
Written in c++, A course work of Fundamentals of Computer Programming
This is a original realization of Josh Wardle's Wordle and I didn't refer to any others' previous project.
All the notes are written in Chinese but can be easily translated into English with common translators.
The GUI version is based on Easyx.
